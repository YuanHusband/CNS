### Intro to Splunk Overview

I chose the "Intro to Splunk" elearning course. It covered a broad range of material, including an intro to Splunk achitecture and basic functions. It gave depth on defining Splunk apps and also demonstrating user roles wiithin. This is essential to navigate Splunk effectivey.

During course progression, I was instructed on basic searches, time ranges, and how to save search results. I gained further understanding on how to work with events and share different searches with others. This included search result exports and selecting different search modes.

A highlight of exploring Search Processing Language was the use of wildcards, case sensitivity, and boolean operations for advance dsearches. I delved into the search langauge and query "best practices."

I understood knowledge objects: data interpretation, classifications, enrichment, normalization, and data models.

The course concluded with lessons on reports and dashboards. Searches are no longer temporary, demonstration through models and reports have endless possibilities. They have insightful visualizations and fun designs to showcase data.

This course set me up with a string Splunk foundation for data queries and reporting.
