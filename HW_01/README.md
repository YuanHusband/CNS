### Provision a Virtual Machine
This tutorial walked me through provisioning. It started off with creating a provisioning script instead of embedding all the provisioning in the Vagrantfile. Instead, we just put the script within the Vagrantfile. This specific provisioning deployed a local webserver.

### Configure the Network
This tutorial allowed me to establish port forwarding using the Vagrantfile. I used the template and tutorial to change the config for the vm network to be hosted on 4567. From here, I accessed this file from the browser at the local host : portnumber (127.0.0.1/4567).
