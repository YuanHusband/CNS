### Research a Security Tool

Sherlock is a kali Linux tool written in python 3. This tool finds usernames across social networks.

The tool can be found at: https://www.kali.org/tools/sherlock/.

Sherlock is open source and exposes usernames by checking databases from thousands of popular account-based websites. This includes anything from Reddit to Quizlet to Fortnite to Redbubble.

Sherlock is a tool that would be used by attackers to spread access. Upon already hacking into one account, the hacker uses sherlock to propagate this breach to other services. Critical accounts being banking related.

Sherlock would also be an amazing tool to combine with a cracked password with a quick script that attempts the password at every account.

## Demonstration of Sherlock (Easy Demo)

Below will explain a use of Sherlock as a stand alone task. This task communicates to thousands of user-based web services but does not interact with network hosts in the traditional sense.

Here is a screenshot of me using Sherlock on a typical LT Quarry username.
