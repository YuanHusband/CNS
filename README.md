Computer and Network Security

This repository represents a holding place and sharing platform for my lab files.

I chose VSCode as my text editor due to its ease of use and Git integration. It is also what I am used to UI-wise.

I downloaded the AMD64 binary verison of Vagrant. I then installed the boundary using the WIndows Installer (.msi file). I added the Vagrant binary to my system at C:\HashiCorp\Vagrant\bin\vagrant.exe. I did not have to either two options as the Windows installer took care of the binary and executable path was handled automatically. Windows integrated into the system without manual adding to an executable path.
